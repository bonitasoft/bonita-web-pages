# Autogenerated forms translations

This folder contains the translations scripts and tools to upload to Crowdin language files
concerning the 2 auto-generated forms, namely process-autogenerated-form and task-autogenerated-form.

## Integration

The entrypoint `upload.sh` is not integrated anymore to any CI job or pipeline, as those 2 forms are considered to be stable and not subject to any change.

Therefore, the translations are uploaded to Crowdin manually, in case of rare change, on demand.

## usage

```bash
upload.sh --crowdin-api-key=$CROWDIN_API_TOKEN --branch=${branch} --crowdin-project=${env.CROWDIN_PROJECT}
```
